# Sentiment Analysis and Prediction in Python

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of sentiment analysis and prediction in Python. It analyzes the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of text data and predicts the sentiment of new text inputs using machine learning techniques.

## Installation
To use this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- NLTK
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:
## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries as mentioned above.
3. Run the `sentiment_analysis.py` script.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to analyze text sentiment or predict sentiment for new text inputs.

## Features
- Perform sentiment analysis on text data.
- Predict sentiment for new text inputs.
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation.
